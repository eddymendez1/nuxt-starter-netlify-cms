## What are web3 games?

 Web 3 games are digital games that use blockchain technology as an underlying component of a game's economy.

Web3 games are a new type of online gaming that has been gaining popularity because it offers some unique features. The most noticeable difference between web based (non-blockchain) and blockchain versions is how player assets (like Connect Four pieces ) can be traded, liquidated or sold for cash. 

Eights Games reimagines popular abstract strategy games, like Connect 4, by adding web3 elements to create exciting new ways to play.

To start playing web3 games, you must first install Metamask on your browser. We'll walk you through how to get started with Metamask step by step

## How to set up Metamask

MetaMask is a free and secure browser extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. With it, web applications can read and write from your digital assets without any hassle.

### Step 1. Install MetaMask wallet on your browser.

To create a new wallet, you must first install browser extension. Then depending on your browser there are different marketplaces that offer MetaMask. This guide uses Google Chrome but the same steps apply to different browsers.

* You need to first verify your secret phrase by entering the previously generated phrase in the correct order. Click Confirm.

And that's it; now you successfully have created your MetaMask account. A new Ethereum wallet address was just made for you. Next you need to deposit funds which we explain steps below.

* You can now see your public address and share it with other people. There are some methods to buy coins offered by MetaMask, but you can do it differently as well; you just need your address.

The MetaMask extension will now always be available in your browser's toolbar, and will serve as your gateway to the web3 world. It's easily accessible and straightforward. But if something wrong happens, and you need to restore your account, you have this option. Of course, first, you have to back it up, and let's look at how we can do that.

### How to backup and restore your Metamask wallet

Suppose you change your browser or computer and want to connect your wallet again; here's how to do it. First, find your seed phrase, which should be stored.

* Click on the account icon.
* Click Settings.
* Find Reveal Seed Words and click it.
* Enter your password.

Now save the Secret Seed Phrase somewhere, preferably not digitally. The backup is done now. All you have to do now is restore your account.

* Open Metamask and click Import using the account seed phrase.
* Enter your Seed Phrase.
* Create a new strong password.
* Click Restore.
